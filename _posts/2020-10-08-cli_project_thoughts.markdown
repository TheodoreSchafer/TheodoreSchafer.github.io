This project was a test of my patience. I had yet to run into a lab that had made my brain blank out and get flustered more than this project did. Only when I thought about the simplicity of the goal the project had did I calm down and convince myself I was capable of creating the CLI from scractch. I found myself re-learning, or maybe remembering, object orientation and that felt like I was truly getting somewhere and understanding what I was typing. 

After deciding which API I wanted to use, the porject took a few sit downs to finish. Amongst a busy work schedule it felt rewarding to piece this together. I have learned that writing notes into my code as reminders of what I am trying to accomplish is extremely helpful. Although, I still feel I am trying to find my stride with how I am able to learn all of this info. But, Im getting close, this was a big step in the right direction.
