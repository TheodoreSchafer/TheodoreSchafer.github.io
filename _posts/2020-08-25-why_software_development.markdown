I often try to figure out why I make the decisions that I do, and I am not sure I ever have much luck in understanding. When I think back to the phases I have had, through high school, college, and my professional career, there have been many instances where the concept of learning to code software has been in the back of my brain. I know that I have always felt some type of attraction to the idea of knowing how to code, but have not yet felt confident or desperate enough in my existence to prepare myself to put in the hours to learn it. 

After quitting my job as a sound designer for a company in New Mexico, I wanted to learn a new skill and expand my identity as a type of content creator, or whatever you might call it. I want to know how to execute the ideas I have in my head, and these ideas require me to know how to develop software. I guess my slowly encroaching desire to code and the current political/economic situation became a catalyst in the decision I have been attempting to make for years.
